Biostatistical miscellaneous functions
--------------------------------------
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/AEBilgrau/Bmisc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AEBilgrau/Bmisc)

My frequently used biostatistical miscellaneous R functions and utilities. While many functions are useful in general, the aim of package is to be particularly useful for general microarray analysis, gene network analysis, and other biostatistical applications.

While most functions are for build for convenience some are optimized for speed through the **Rcpp** and **RcppArmadillio** packages. **Bmisc** uses **roxygen2** for documenting the package.

## Installation
If you wish to install the latest version of Bmisc directly from the master branch here at GitHub, run 

```R
#install.packages("devtools")  # Uncomment if devtools is not installed
devtools::install_github("AEBilgrau/Bmisc")
```

The package is constantly under development and may be unstable. Be sure that you have the [package development prerequisites](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/packages/prerequisites) if you wish to install the package from the source.
